![[Peroc, the Scavenger.webp|left|512]]

# Background
Peroc is a resourceful and opportunistic half-orc. He's always on the lookout for what he refers to as 'reshza'.

Despite his rough exterior, he possesses a sharp wit and at times a sly sense of humor. He is fiercely independent and distrustful of authority, preferring to operate on the fringes of society where he can carve out his own path. However, he is not without a sense of loyalty, and those who earn his trust will find a steadfast ally in him.

Peroc's primary motivation is survival. He has endured hardship and prejudice throughout his life, and he knows that in order to thrive in a world that often seeks to cast him aside, he must rely on his wits and cunning. He is driven by a desire to amass wealth and power, not out of greed, but out of necessity â€“ knowing that in a world where strength is often measured in gold, having resources at his disposal is the key to his continued survival.
