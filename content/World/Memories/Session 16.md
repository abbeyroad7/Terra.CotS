# Hanging at the Gallows
After taking a short rest in the backroom of the Tavern, the party hear a knock at the door, followed by an intimidating Cervan. He addresses [[Sardaen]] asking why they'd been looking for him. He invites Sardaen, along with [[Borislav]] and [[Scribbles]] to a corner table inside the Tavern, where a gruff Tiefling is sitting.

The Cervan introduces himself as [[Vander Warhoof]], a Gloridian veteran from the Before Days. The Tiefling refers to himself as Servius, a well-known Tiefling for his military prowess against the [[Thorcs]] in the [[Battle of Amarok]]. The four talked over recent events, where the party had met [[Hilda Goldvein]], and were ambushed at the church with her followers. The party defeated the attackers and with Kaldor's advice, fled to rally more members for the [[Arcane Liberation Front|ALF]] to oppose the Celestrian conspiracy. The four came to a consensus that they needed to gather intel on the Celestrian high-command, and to do so, would require breaking into the [[Citadel]].

After agreeing on a plan, the party gathered to a nearby shipping wearhouse [[Vander]] and [[Sirvius]] worked at. Here, they changed their clothes to various cloth coverings in order to disguise as civilians.

While changing, two Celestrian guards entered the warehouse, and commanded everyone outside to witness the daily executions. A large crowd had gathered at the gallows. Among the three doomed men, was Victor  and KING.

A commanding officer addressed the crowd, declaring their intention to put down any rebellion aligned with the King. They pulled the lever, releasing the death door for the OLD and BANKER. In a charming display of affectation for the King, the party rallied the crowd to push to give the King a final kiss. This angered the guards, who responded by killing an old woman. Outraged, a riot ensued.

In the chaos, the party launched [[Yeldarb]] onto the stage and engaged with the soldiers. Soonafter, from behind the gallows, the Celestrians led a chained giant Monstrosity with a slingblade fixated into his arm. Unable to hold the Monstrosity any longer, it tore through the stage, killing several soldiers in the process.

The crowd and soldiers fled alike, and the party retreated to the warehouse across the street, where the monster followed. In a final showdown in the warehouse, the party fell the monster (almost too easily) and took stock of their weapons.
