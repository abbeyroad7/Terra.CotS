![[Dorian Blackwood.webp|left|512]]
# Background
Dorian Blackwood is an adult human part of the Aurelian Lumber's Guild.

# Encounters
The party met Dorian in their search for [[Hilda Goldvein]]. He had perched himself into a tree over the abandoned Lumber Camp after [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] soldiers attacked and raided the site after they'd heard word the dwarf they were searching for was hiding out there. He sat there for 2 days overseeing the camp, longbow ready for any soldiers foolish enough to return.

As the party had entered the camp, he was unsure of their affiliation and took aim at the adventurers. A skirmish ensued until the party cut him out the tree he sat in. [[Yeldarb]] informed the man that they were unaffiliated with [[Order of Celestria|Celestria]] and were merely looking for [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]]. Realizing his error, Dorian dropped his bow and let the party know the female dwarf they have been looking for fled to the [[Eldermyst River]] further north.
