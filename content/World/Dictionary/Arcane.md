# Introduction
The source of magical energy in the world of [[Terra]]. Commonly referred to as Creation Energy by [[Arilias, the One True Creator|Arilias']] followers.

# Origins
In the before, it is believed [[Arilias, the One True Creator|Arilias]] channeled a surge of [[Arcane]] to create the world of [[Terra]]. By doing so, an influx of dark energy sprang forth, named [[Umbra]]. Disproportionately greater than its precursor, Umbra became like a rampant cancer, insidiously devouring all the Creation it could reach.

Understanding the peril of Umbra, Arilias trapped the remaining dark energy into [[Svalgheim]], a [[Tangent Realms|Tangent Realm]] forever sealed off from Terra. Over millennia, the Umbra transformed and mutated into the dreaded hordes of the underworld.
