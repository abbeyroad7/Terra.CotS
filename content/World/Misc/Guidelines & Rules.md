# Introduction
When we first started this campaign in the February of 2024, me and the original players had convened together to establish what the game will look like in terms of gameplay.

This Session 0 reflects the tone of our campaign and I would refer any new players to these guidelines so they can know what to expect when joining our world.

# Player Behavior
- Please understand that this is a game, and I try my best to make it fun and excitable for my players, so don't be a dick. I know dice rolls can be frustrating sometimes, but remember that it's just a game.
- We play digitally, so eating, bathroom breaks, answers calls/texts are to be expected, but try and stay focused during the game, and if you need to step away for any reason, try and not to be too distracting to your fellow players.
# PvP
- For many of us, this campaign is our first introduction to DND. The original idea of starting this campaign is to have an outlet for all of us to keep contact, and work together as a group and to go on wacky adventures while doing it. PvP defeats that purpose and as such, is expressly forbidden at the table.
# Tone
- The overall tone of this campaign is to be light-hearted and fun. I will introduce elements of horror and violence at times, as this is Dungeons and Dragons, but I still want the game to be rooted in friendship and cooperation.

# Scheduling
- We will honor a biweekly schedule every other Tuesday at 7pm. This schedule is contingent on the availabilty of everyone, so it may change in the future.
- If some players are unavailable, we will continue the session unless we bypass a minimum of 3 players.
# Longevity
- I would like to homebrew this world as much as I can and develop it into something that's as diverse and alive on its own. That being said, I understand long story arcs may not be the most feasible, so I will plan to dedicate *Chapters* I'm currently outlining each *Chapter* to be no more than a few months in duration, and may adjust this in the future to fit the needs of our players.
