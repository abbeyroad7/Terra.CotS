![[Siege of Aurelia.webp|center|512]]
# Introduction
As the [[Order of Celestria|Celestrians]] reached a boiling point with the ruling [[Gloridia|Gloridian]] government, they led a blitzed siege against the Empire's capital in an attempted coup d'etat. After days of brutal violence, the ruling class fled [[Aurelia]], leaving its inhabitants to the brutal reign of the Celestrian Guard.
