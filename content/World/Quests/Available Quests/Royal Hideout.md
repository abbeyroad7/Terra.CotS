# Objective
Seek out the hideout location at the Aurelian National Bank.

# Background
Upon opening the lockbox belonging to the Knave family, Goobert saw a glimpse into what appeared to be a memory inside the national bank, where a member of the royal family in [[Aurelia]] had sought shelter on the lower level of the bank, during what appeared to be a mass execution during the [[Celestrian Siege]].
