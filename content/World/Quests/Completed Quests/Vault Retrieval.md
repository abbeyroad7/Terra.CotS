Shortly after arriving to the [[Knave's Scroll]] Tavern, the party stepped in to save the bar-keep [[Wald Knave, Innkeeper]] and his son [[Batti Knave, Innkeeper]] from Celestrian soldiers. In the ensuing brawl, Wald had his throat slit, prompting the party to defeat the aggressors and stabilize the gravely-wounded man. With vapid breath, Wald held out his hand and handed Borislav a rustic golden key. He explained that it unlocks a family vault in the [[Aurelian National Bank]]. 

Wald lost consciousness, unable to further explain its contents. Batti thanked the party for their heroism and frantically began packing essentials to flee the country with his injured father.
