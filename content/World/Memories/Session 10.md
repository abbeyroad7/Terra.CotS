# Bank Vault
Upon returning to ALF-HQ, the party was commended for bringing back the fae prisoners, [[Elli Peer]] and [[Puck]].

Soon after, Borislav's hip began to suspiciously warm and pulsate with a faint blue light. After rummaging through his pockets, he revealed the golden key that the party had been gifted from saving [[Batti Knave, Innkeeper|Batti]] and [[Wald Knave, Innkeeper|Wald]] at the [[Knave's Scroll]].

Upon further study, [[Goobert]] revealed that the key bore an origin bereft of the old artisans from before [[The Arcanum Wars]]. [[Rasha Moonstar|Rasha]] began pouring over the ancient texts to match the old key. He returned to the party a short-while later, informing them that the key's handle bears an insignia that of the Gods, and warned them of the possible dangers to unlocking the vault it belongs to.

The party then decided it was in their piqued interest to travel to the [[Aurelian National Bank]] in the [[Citadel District]]. Upon entering the secured building, the party was acosted by Celestrian soldiers and asked for purpose of visit. Borislav explained they had need to open the Knave Vault.

The teller behind the glass prompted for documentation to substantiate their claim to the vault. While being questioned, Yeldarb proudly proclaimed himself a kinsmen of the Knaves. Realizing his grave error, Yeldarb clamored for time to distract the teller and the Celestrian guard. He pulled out his battleaxes and began juggling them, drawing the attention of more soldiers.

Before they could apprehend the armed barbarian, he flung an axe up and missed the catch. The axe bore into the bank shelf, splitting it into two. Amused, the teller decided not to press charges, and merely billed the performer for his damages.

Meanwhile, [[Scribbles]] had been forging a birth certificate for a 'Yeldarb Knave' and had come scampering behind the distracted foot soldiers. The faked document was accepted, and the party was led back into the vaults by yet another guard escort.

Here, they were instructed that only one person may enter at any given time, whilst being watched by two more armed guards inside the vault. The others must wait outside. The party deliberated for a moment, before sending in [[Goobert]] with the key as he tended to be the most investigative member of the group.

Inside Goobert came face to face with a wall of vaults, each with their own respective lock box. He recognized some were inscribed with emblems and names, but he did not see one written for Knave. In an act of desperation, he went back out to consult with the rest of the party and pieced together the correct emblem to seek out.

After pulling the lockbox, Goobert brought it to the center-podium and opened it. Inside, a rather plain-looking grey stone, the size of a fully-grown [[Cloudhopper|Cloudhopper]] skull, lay. The grey plasmoid shrugged his liquid shoulders, and as he lifted the stone, his eyes saw a flash of pale blue light.

The soldier escorts were gone. He was fully alone. He wandered around, inspecting the corners, suspecting some sort of joke was being played, but he was still alone.

Reminiscent of his old ways, the Plasmoid pondered the thought of lockpicking the unattended vaults, but on his attempt to do so, his arm passed through. Puzzled by his spectral presence, he walked to the vault door, and then, walked straight through.

On the opposite side of the vault door, the party had gone, and he was still alone. Down the hallway, he could hear muffled scuttling, and as he approached, a large older man with royal garb passed through his body. A few of his servants followed, low to the ground. Before Goobert could react, he heard a piercing scream towards the bank entrance. Rather than investigate, he followed the Royal Man and his servants down to the lower level of the bank.

Here, he watched as they went to the sideroom away from the master vault, and pushed a hidden switch on the painting hung on the left side. The painting swiveled, like a door on hinges and revealed a hidden room. Him and his servants went inside.

Before Goobert could follow, his vision contorted and he was transported back into the vault upstairs, with the two guard escorts standing over him. He quickly regained his composure and tucked away the stone into his bag. The party regathered and left the bank promptly.

On their return back to HQ, Goobert stumbled to a knee. Freya attempted to help the Plasmoid back to his feet, and in doing so, they were both enveloped into a visage of the Aurelian Siege. The city street before them revealed fire and rubble sprewn about. Women and children were screaming. Men were being dragged out of their homes and slaughtered by Celestrian soldiers. In the distance, Freya and Goobert could hear a maniacal laugh. A high-pierced shrill cacal broke through the screams.

A flash of blue light shot across their eyes, and the two were shot back to the present.
