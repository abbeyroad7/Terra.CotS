# Introduction
The Arcanum Wars were a series of global conflicts immediately following [[The Divine Restoration]] in 1388 [[Terra Calendar (TC)|TC]] and ultimately ending nearly 200 years later in 1564 TC. It was the most divisive and destructive period of history since the [[World/History/Conflicts/Cataclysm of the Shattered|Cataclysm of the Shattered]].

After the Catalysm, [[Arilias, the One True Creator|Arilias]] drew a deep breath, inviting the waters of the [[Leyaub Ocean]] to seep forth and quench the scorched earth. This created the [[Perlas Sea]] to the south of modern-day [[Thorq]] and [[Balfran]], which tragically engulfed what was once entire countries home to millions of peoples.

These events led to a continued global instability as regional powers vied for control of the newly-forged peninsula. Some sought to unbury the vast deposit of Arcana, while others tried to keep it hiden at all costs. After countless searches through the decades, the still-unfound deposit settled into the common mythos, as the [[Den of Necromancy]].

# Conclusion
The end of the Arcanum Wars came in 1564, when the lands of [[Thorq]] and [[Balfran]] signed a mutual Defense Pact with the [[Westler|Duchy of Westler]], leading to the signing of the [[Klaven Armistice]] shortly thereafter.

What followed was nearly 70 years of uneasy global peace, as a renaissance of human and dwarf-led technology flourished with the decline of Arcane energy and a cold war between east and west emerged.
