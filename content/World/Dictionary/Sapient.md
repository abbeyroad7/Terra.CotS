# Introduction

In [[Terra]], sapients are sentient creatures that possess a level of consciousness that display both a conceptual understanding of their place in the physical world and an inward awareness of themselves. These creatures are often humanoid in nature, most-often bipedal, and often congregate within social groups.

See the list of known Sapients in the [[Races]] page.
