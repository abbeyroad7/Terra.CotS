# Affiliations in Ironwharf
Taking heed of [[Dorian Blackwood|Dorian's]] word, the party began walking north, following the [[Eldermyst River]] in search of [[Hilda Goldvein]]. Much like their camp the night before, the party soon came upon another encampment attended to by three illustrious craftsmen, who introduced themselves as [[Garrick Ryder]], [[Balin Stonebeard]], and [[Tommy Shellback]].

The three men had been traveling to the city to market their ornamental wearables to the wealthy of [[Aurelia]].

When the party asked if they had seen a female dwarf pass through, the men explained they had not, but she would likely be heading to the city if she were heading north. [[Garrick Ryder|Garrick]] offered the adventurers a ride, in exchange for *4GP*, in which they accepted.

On the boat, the party took awe of a pack of [[Gomitoads]] flipping through the water's surface, which were swallowed whole by a large [[Traulauth]] shortly after. In surprise, [[Yeldarb]] stumbled backward and accidentally knocked [[Freya]] overboard. She disappeared from view as the vessel veered right as the river had split into two divgering streams due to an eyelot in their path.

The party continues on, and after a few hours, they arrive to Ironwharf Harbor, in the [[Aurelia|Rusthaven]] district of [[Aurelia]]. After providing their documentation papers, the party steps onto the pier, where they meet a religious cultist brandishing a hand-painted sign, chanting, "The end times are nigh!" over and over.

[[Scribbles]] and [[Yeldarb]] make their way over to a half-elvish child playing alone by the dock's edge. She explains to them she is attempting to lure out a furry mouse hiding behind some barrels in the stowaway of a wooden cart. The Kenku offers to lend a hand, and uses his staff to prod the barrels. As he prods, the cart begins to shake violently, before the back wheel busts off the axel, careening the barrels forward. [[Scribbles]] manages to save the child, but the barrels crash onto the ground, splattering wine everywhere.

A nearby [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] guard sees this, and accuses the three of trying to steal. He says to them per [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] law, thieves are to face Capital punishment, but he will settle for the removal of thieves' hands instead.

A [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] captain watching from afar comes forward and pleads with the soldier to release the party and the child. Begrungingly, the soldier relents and leaves to cleanup the mess, while continuing to mutter profanities under his breath.

The [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] captain invites the party for a drink at the Rusty Anchor, a rustic tavern nearby. Here they meet the owner, a man named [[Thadius Twen]]. His daughter, [[Eirian Twen|Eirian]] bursts through the door, holding back tears as she explains to her father of the recent events. The beguiled man thanks for the Captain and the party for their heroism and announces drinks on the house for everyone.

It is here that the Captain introduces himself as [[Renroc Regalbrook]], a former Gloridian Captain, charged with overseeing the pier after the [[Siege of Aurelia]]. He further explains that his father had held the rank previously, before being killed at the hands of [[Order of Celestria|Celestrians]]. After [[Scribbles]] inquires to the man about finding [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]], Renroc questions their allegiance to the woman. With furhter questioning, Renroc reveals that he holds no affiliation to his men or to the [[Order of Celestria|Order]]. He goes on to say, that [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] had personally alerted him of the party's arrival, and that he was also a member of the [[Arcane Liberation Front]].

After hours, [[Renroc Regalbrook|Renroc]] invites the party to follow him, where he leads them through various alleyways to an innocuous looking door several blocks over. The Captain then unlocks the door and ushers the party inside.
