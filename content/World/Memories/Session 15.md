# Escape Rusthaven
Along with survivors from the Churchyard, the party followed [[Kaldor Steelhide]] through the alleyways of Rusthaven, to appeal to some more influential leaders in the area.

On the way, they stumbled upon a trio of [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] soldiers who had been drinking in the street. While the party discussed stealthing around them, one of the soldiers had dropped their bottle of liquor, and gotten up to retrieve another. He turned the corner and ran into [[Renroc Regalbrook|Renroc]]. [[Renroc Regalbrook|Renroc]] attempted to convince the soldier that they were ordered by the Coven of Celestria and were seeking the whereabouts of [[Hilda Goldvein]]. The low-ranking soldier did not know who they were talking about, but allowed the party to pass.

[[Renroc Regalbrook|Renroc]] and Kaldor stepped out and ran into the two other soldiers waiting nearby. On questioning Renroc, one of the soldiers had asked them to wait a moment, as he had believed the nature of their mission would be of interest to his commanding officer.

Renroc, alarmed by being discovered, cast Sleep on both soldiers and was able to successfully knock one unconscious. The other was dazed, but still alert and entered combat with the party. He was able to shortly alert the rest of his comrades nearby of the surprise attack.

The party battled for some time, but were able to defeat all four [[Order of Celestria|Celestrians]] without any casualties. They continued on up the street to [[Sardaen Orestone|Sardaen Orestone's]] house, where [[Scribbles]] burst through the door. A bewildered Sardaen was calmed by Kaldor and as the Dragonborn leader explained the situation, Sardaen accepted his new quest and led the party away to find [[Sirvius the Bold]] and [[Vander Warhoof]].

As the party followed Sardaen down the alley, [[Sam Greyscale]] lingered behind and disappeared into the shadows.

The party came into town and took short refuge in a tavern frequented by Sirvius and Vander.
