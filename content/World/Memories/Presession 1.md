# That Time the Fire Genasi Befriended a Polar Bear
After being exiled to the tundras of Ettnia, Freya set up camp in  a remote area by a lake full of fish. One day, a polar bear wandered into her camp. When Freya attempted to fight off the bear, she quickly learned she could not defeat the large mammal and chose instead to reason with the beast. Using Speak with Animals, she managed to convince the bear that she could wrestle up some fish, 3 specimens to be exact, as a peace offering.

With no lure or net in hand, she used Speak with Animals again to call out to the fish to trick them into coming to shore. She managed to catch 2, but could not catch a third. With her sleight of hand, she chopped up the second fish in half and through the pieces out to vivacious polar bear, who didn't realize he had been tricked. It was then that they started their friendship, and Freya's igloo shortly became home to the bear as well.

# The Death of Emeric
On a regular patrol through [[Zeilona]], Borislav and his comrade, Emeric, encountered a Gloridian patrol. The two soldiers fought for their lives and managed to fend off the invaders, but Emeric ultimately succumbed to his wounds - dying in Borislav's arms. The passing of his friend deeply affected Borislav, and perhaps became the most traumatic event in his entire servitude to the Zeilonan Army.
