# Background
The Trawlauth is a freshwater-placental mammal that primarily feeds on fish and other small aquatic organisms. Though, it has been known to swallow larger prey, including lone young sapients. As a stalking predator, the Trawlauth uses its rigid and flaky, dark-brown speckled skin to hide amidst the murky waterbed, before lunging at its prey from below the water's surface.
# Encounters
While traveling along the [[Eldermyst River]], [[Player Characters|The Good Guys, and then Yeldarb]] had caught a quick glimpse of the Traulauth as it hunted a pack of [[Gomitoad|Gomitoads]]. This incident surprised [[Yeldarb]], causing him to accidentally knock [[Freya]] overboard.
