# Description
Skulks are violent, invisible entities only visible by reflection. On the rare occasions when a skulk is visible, it appears as a drab, hairless biped.
# Encounters
The town of Anmouth was invaded by a horde of Skulk and some of them have seemingly taken to 'haunting' the town, continuing the townspeople's daily mundane activities.
