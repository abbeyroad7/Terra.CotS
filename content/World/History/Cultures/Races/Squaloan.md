# Squaloan
“Aye, I can take you 'cross the water, but its gonna cost ya'.” stated the older dwarf, his thick grayed beard drenched in whatever foul smelling ale he was drinking. “See those are squal waters. Normally fine folk, if you follow their rules. But step out a'line, or - gods forbid! - bring a merfolk, and you're shark meat friend.” “Don’t give them a bad name. They’ve saved many ships” protested the younger elven man sitting next to him. “And sunk just as many! Now, do ya' want my ship or not?”

Tall, frightening, and tailless shark-like creatures with a wicked smile, squaloans often terrify would be sailors from ever crossing the seas. From lone hunters, to groups sized in the small hundreds, squaloan call the seas home. Very little ties an individual squaloan to another, but most form families in parts of the ocean rich with life, like coral reefs. While separate, and often very different in culture, two things binds them together: An extreme distrust of merfolk and fey, and an innate brutish nature that often leads to conflict.

# Mercanaries of the Sea
Squaloans tread on the borders between civility and tribalism at all times. Each clan finds its own way of life, but most tend to lead to a similar path. Due to their immense strength and knowledge of the seas, it's extremely common for sailors to hire local clans of squaloan to guide ships. As long as the sailors pay what they are due, there's rarely issue, but due to a few greedy sailors many have heard of the ferocity of a hostile squoloan.
This coupled with the more territorial and hostile tribes gives squaloan a bad reputation among many, and has lead to several cities hunting them to near extinction.

# Friends for Life
Squaloans dont often make friends outside their tribe, often finding bond in what is called in their tribe a “Squail Brother”. This is a permanent bond between two squaloan as hunting family, and while similar to marriage of other races, this does not necessarily entail a romantic relationship.
Squail brothers have an understanding they would die to protect one another, and take this agreement only if one is truly worthy, considering it the highest form of respect. It is unusual but not unheard of for races outside squaloan to become one's Squail brother, but is never mocked or looked down on. To a squaloan, if one is worthy of being called a squail brother, then they are worthy of respect.

# Squaloan Names
Squaloan are not given names at birth, instead they usually decide what it is when they finish their first hunt, but this changes tribe to tribe. The only thing that doesn't change is the first hunt: it's always a fey, a sahuagin, or merrow. The chosen name often focuses on a specific element of that hunt, like a wound inflicted or received, a feeling, or an element of the environment. Squaloan have recently begun to take on human names as more and more interact with other species. Tribe Names take on the location they inhabit.
Common Classic Squaloan Names: Lost Blood, Blue Scales, Festered Wound, Murky, Night

Tribe Names: Of Lost Seas, Beneath Coral Shelves, Beside rocky shores, Of the depths unseen

# Perceived by
Humans: Friend or foe, no one can deny squaloans birth right. Their tribes know the seas better than most, and any ship friends with one is lucky indeed, and woe to those that are enemies to them.
Dwarves: What's a Squaloan? Heard the name, but can't remember where from. Some ocean creature I think, but about all gone. Makin' too many enemies, foolish of 'em.
Elves: Brutish creatures, they demand payment in territory ruled by others and attack like common bandits. Nothing good comes from them.
Dragonborn: Honorable, can't deny that. They always impress how capable they are, even being hunted they live and maintain their lifestyle well.

# Squaloan Brute
Nicknamed "Slayers of men", the brutes' raw aggression has led the species as a whole to having a bad name. The smell of any large amount of blood in the water pushes them towards a ferocious frenzy, attacking whatever is bleeding. This, on top of being some of the larger of their kind, leads to an imposing figure often teetering on and off the edge of brutality.

**Ability Score Increase** Your Constitution score increases by 1.
**Brute Frenzy** The smell of blood drives you into a frenzy. Once per turn, when you damage a Blood Frenzy target with a melee weapon or an unarmed strike, you can cause the attack to deal 1d4 extra damage of the same type.

**Blood Frenzied Bite** Your feral frenzying causes your bites to rip into targets, making them bleed heavily. When you hit a blood frenzy target with your Bite Attack, you may choose to have the target take half the damage done at the start of each of their turns until they spend their action to stop the bleeding. Once you use this trait, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

# Squaloan Tracker
Whenever a squaloan tribe is struggling with a smarter foe, from single enemies to all out warring, groups are sent with trackers.

Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. This functions only against creatures and objects within the same body of water as you.
**Blood Frenzied Senses** The smell of a dying enemy makes it hard for them to lose you. You can see blood frenzy targets within 30 feet of you as though you had blindsight. This effect extends to 90 feet if both you and the target are in the same body of water. You also gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against said targets.

# Squaloan Chaser
Chasers live and breathe rushing down their targets and keeping distance until the time is right. They hold an integral part in their communities in making sure little to nothing escapes. Their speed allows them to be both a mix of powerful casters maintaining a good distance and quick skirmishers weaving in and out of combat.

**Ability Score Increase** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.
**Blood Frenzied Chase** The smell of blood drives you to chase your prey down, refusing to let it escape. As a bonus action you can target one Blood Frenzy target.

# Deep Ocean Squaloan

You can also cause the light to emit in a specific design from your body, such as a skeleton or lightning bolts.

**Blood Frenzied Curse:** Choose one blood frenzy target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Blood Frenzy Save DC. A target automatically succeeds on the saving throw if they do not not rely on sight or cannot be charmed. On a failed save, the target becomes blinded. While blinded this way, the target can can only faintly perceive sources of light. At the end of their turn, they can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect.

# Barbarian Subclass
## Path of the Shark
The brutality of a shark is known by all, ripping into prey, or dragging them into the depths and shaking it apart. In this same sense, Path of the Shark barbarians choose to channel their raw power into their enemies, gripping them tight and tearing them apart piece by bloody piece.
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Shark often leave battle bathed in blood, dragging future trophies back with them.
