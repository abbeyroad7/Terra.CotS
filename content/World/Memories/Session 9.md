# Escape from Amber Quay
After apprehending Elli and Puck, the party decided to look around the [[Amber Quay]] market on the way back. They purchased some items, both magical and nonmagical from the black market.

Elli had mentioned that he had a connection to one of the shopkeepers, where he needed to finalize a deal that was overdue. The players walked over to a sickly, but sly old man with a rat perched on his shoulder and a black crow caged upon his desk. 

Elli pushed for his payment of 20 poison-dipped daggers, but the shopkeep regretfully admitted that the shipment was delayed, as his smuggling operations have taken a hit with the recent occupation.

Scribbles attempted to threaten the old man for the freedom of his crow companion, but the old man instead sold off the bird to Scribbles for 5 GP.

After the old man's stall, the party perused the goods of other vendors before a scream was heard at the other end of the market. 

Through a crack in the wall, a tiny creature slithered through, contorting its body through the narrow slit and pooling onto the ground. It reset its mangled limbs and lunged at the nearest standerby, killing them and the merchant procuring a sale.

The party lunged into action and attacked the creature. It got a few hits in on the Good Guys, before dying cornered in a stall.

As the party regathered, a large abomination burst through the main entrance to the market. The beast stood upright, resembling a man above its torso. Below, it slithered with a hundred legs, akin to a centipede.
