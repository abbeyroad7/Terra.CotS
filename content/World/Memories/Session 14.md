# The Churchyard Massacre
Renroc led the party through Rusthaven alleyways to his safe house, where the party met [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]]. She welcomed the party warmly. She thanked them for helping her family. She then passed a sealed envelope to Renroc, and ushered the party inside to rest.

In the middle of the night, everyone (minus [[Scribbles]] of course) awoke to a soft click of the back door opening. [[Renroc Regalbrook|Renroc]] sprinted to the door while the rest of the party instinctively hid. A lone shadowy figure entered the room, and the Celestrian commander, used Suggestion to persuade the stranger to fall to the ground on their hands and knees. Standing over the figure, [[Renroc Regalbrook|Renroc]] called out to the party if they recognized the intruder, and [[Elara Moonshade|Elara]] clarified that it was [[Freya]].

[[Freya]] rejoined her comrades and explained she had been awoken by [[Spite, the Domestic Crow|Spite]] along the riverbank. [[Spite, the Domestic Crow|Spite]] had guided her to the safehouse.

[[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] had come down to meet [[Freya]], and upon reaching her, she became transfixed on [[Freya|Freya's]] bag. Instinctively, [[Freya]] pulled out the vision stone, and [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] had latched onto it. Her irises clouded over and she became unresponsive. Frozen in place, [[Freya]] swore she had seen a reflection of fire in her eyes.

Between short-breaths, [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] appeared visibly shaken. She turned to [[Renroc Regalbrook|Renroc]], and instructed him to get everyone upstairs as soon as possible. "There is no time to waste," she said.

The party climbed up the stairs to a decrepit church, where dim lanterns illuminate a center stage, and [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] had climbed onto to address a small and confused croud.

[[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda's]] face had grown sullen and had seemingly-aged like it'd been years from only hours before. She waited a moment before beginning. [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] spoke softly at first, heavy with a hint of sorrow.

"For many moons, I've listened to the Whisper. It has foretold to me events far and wide, unrelenting in its honest visage (viz-ige). Its latest tellings are marred by the despair of our once beautiful city and the good people that live here. One message, keeps repeating itself through the fog," her voice wavered.

"Beware the Voidwalker, for when He walks, the false land will unhinge its ravenous maw. For when He walks, the lifeless sky will weep from the blood of stars unseen. For when He walks, the Age of Shadow will envelop us all."

[[Kaldor Steelhide]], a well-respected civil leader in Rusthaven, stands and asks, "What do these words mean?". Others in the room ask if [[Aurelia]] is safe, and if they need to leave the city.

[[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] immediately responds with conviction, "The future is uncertain, but from what I've heard, leaving would be a mistake. No one is safe from the Voidwalker."

In the distance, [[Scribbles]] hear a far-off crow cawing. As the feathers on the back of his neck stand up in anticipation, a large explosion rocks the building. The left wall sends out debris, instantly killing a nearby follower, and through the dust, a crowd of [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] soldiers pour through the crumbling wall.

As the party arms themselves, the front doors are blasted open and more soldiers pour through. Leading the enemy forces at the entrance is Anato, a corpeal figure cloaked in smoke wielding dual flaming swords. The party and followers rush to meet the enemy forces, and many civilians die in the onslaught.

After sustaining critical damage, Anato used her mystical abilities and teleported behind the ranged members of the Good Guys, to flank the party. Here, Anato charged head-on with [[Goobert]] and [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]], where the prophetic Dwarf was killed.

Soonafter, the party managed to defeat the enemy forces and corner one surviving soldier. [[Renroc Regalbrook|Renroc]] questioned the man and discovered the order to attack the church was in response to trailing the party and to eliminate [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] at all costs. The order had been given by the Coven of Celestria, a secretive coalition of aristocrats that rule over [[Order of Celestria|Celestria]].

Upon looting the body of the second-in-command, the party had found he had been wearing a medellion, adorned with a human-like ourborous etched over silver. Scribbles immediately recognized the symbol from a book the party had collected from their brief time in [[Anmouth]] - [[The Teachings of the Hand of Scion]].

The surviving [[Matilda Goldvein|Goldvein]] followers - [[Sam Greyscale]], [[Zythara Silverblade]] and [[Kaldor Steelhide]] surmised that the [[Cult of Scion]] was somehow tied to the [[Order of Celestria]].

Kaldor and the party planned their next move to rally with other formidable leaders in [[Aurelia|Rusthaven]], and to leave the church through the secret entrance before reinforcements arrived.
