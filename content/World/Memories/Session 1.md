# The Long and Winding Road
[[Borislav]] departs from the town of Thatchking, pulling a horse-drawn carriage to [[Aurelia]] to look for new employment. The fighter seeks to provide stability for his family back home in war-torn [[Zeilona]].  Along the dirt road, he passes a mighty Goliath Barbarian named [[Yeldarb]]. The two introduce themselves and reveal they are both traveling to Aurelia. They decide to ride onward together. As they continue into the night, Borislav notices something out of the corner of his eye - what appears to be an amorphous blob following them.

By nightfall, the pair stop at the [[Knave's Scroll]], a rural inn on the side of the road, roughly 30 verstas outside the town of [[Anmouth]]. As they unload their wagon, the aforementioned blob slimes from out under the wagon, and steals Borislav's bread and cheese and takes off into the wood. Begrudgingly, Borislav and Yeldarb enter the inn, where they meet their hosts - [[Wald Knave, Innkeeper]] and his son [[Batti Knave, Innkeeper]]. Shortly after the two check-in, a Plasmoid named [[Goobert]] enters the inn, suspiciously smelling of a fresh smorgasbord. The Goo-man spooks the lesser-traveled, Wald, whom had never encountered a creature of the sort before. As Borislav and Yeldarb calm the older man, they strike up conversation with Goobert and quickly take a liking to the strange goob.

As the newly-formed three settle in and dine for the night, a section of Celestrian soldiers enter the inn and begin hounding the innkeeper for free lodging and drink. Events quickly escalate as Wald grows weary of their ever-increasing demands. A fight breaks out, and the 3 warriors are able to fight off the soldiers. Unfortunately, Wald's throat is slashed in the brawl, but he is stabilized just before death. With low breath, he gives the party a golden key. His son Batti explains that the key opens a family vault in the [[Aurelian National Bank]] and that the party may have whatever belongs inside as thanks.

The son and father quickly pack their belongings and flee their inn, in hope of escaping the country before more soldiers come for them. The party decides to carry on in their wagon and leave the same night.
