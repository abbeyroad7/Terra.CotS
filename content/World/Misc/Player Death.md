# Introduction
- In the event your player character is downed and fails all 3 of their *Death Saving Throws*, do not take your frustrations out on me as DM. Refer to the *Player Behavior* section under the [[Guidelines & Rules]] page.
- There will always be mortal danger for players as they navigate the open world of [[Terra]]. Though, it is not my specific intention for player characters to fall to these dangers, but they must practice adequate caution to survive. Even with the right safety precautions, this is DND and there is always a chance the dice will choose to end your destiny prematurely.

# Afterdeath
- I will privately reach out to you and ask what your compromise will be. I do not intend to make this campaign a constant struggle between life and death, but I will not shy away from player death if events unfold that way.
- You can choose to temporarily hiatus your character to be revived by the party or by an evil necromancer for example.
- You can introduce another character to join the party, as an already existing character, or an entirely new one.
- You can continue the arc of your character by bringing them back in another form, as a ghost or spirit for example.
- Whatever you choose, I will work with you to compromise on life after death. Just be reasonable.
