# Skulks in Anmouth
As the newly-formed Ball Fondlers lead [[Bergil, the Black Stallion]] and [[Reggie, the Brown Stallion]] to Aurelia, they bring the wagon to a stop in a small town named Anmouth. They strangely find the town center deserted at midday.

As they investigate the tavern, they discover the establishment empty of patrons. [[Borislav]] and [[Goobert]] enter into the kitchen and look for clues. Here they find a hastily-mopped blood-stain behind the leg of a preparation table. As they continue their search, they hear a ghostly whisper behind them. They run to the dining room to join [[Freya]] and find a prepared feast of potatoes and turkey. Famished, Borislav takes a bite of the turkey, and notes that it has no seasoning. Another unembodied whisper passes by the group, they flee outside and look into the church across the townsquare.
