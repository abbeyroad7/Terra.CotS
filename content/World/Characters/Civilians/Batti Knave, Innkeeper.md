# Introduction
Batti is a human in his early 20s who lives and works at the [[Knave's Scroll]] with his father, [[Wald Knave, Innkeeper|Wald]]. A naive kid, he always likes to assume the best in others.

After the brawl with the Celestrian soldiers, Batti took his gravely injured father and fled the country, leaving the Knave's Scroll abandoned.
