# Background
Tarog is a plump and bright-eyed orange tabby with a mischievous streak. Tarog, to the amusement of others, exudes an almost human-like confidence and curiosity, often darting around Peroc's feet as they scavenge the countryside. His fur is soft and well-groomed, a testament to the care Peroc showers over him.
