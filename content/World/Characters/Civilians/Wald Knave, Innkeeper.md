# Introduction
Wald is a middle-aged human who lived and worked at the Knave's Scroll with his son, [[Batti Knave, Innkeeper|Batti]]. A weathered adult, he's grown accustomed to what his customers demand of him, and does his best to take care of his son.

After the brawl with the Celestrian soldiers, Batti took his gravely injured father and fled the country, leaving the Knave's Scroll abandoned.
