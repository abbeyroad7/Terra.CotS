![[Erlic, Celestrian Commander.webp|left|512]]

# Introduction
Not much is known about Erlic's origins beyond his role as Commander to the Celestrian Army. The party encountered him as they settled in to stay at the [[Knave's Scroll]] tavern outside [[Anmouth]].

Erlic and his men acted as belligerents and attacked the tavern owner [[Wald Knave, Innkeeper]] and his son [[Batti Knave, Innkeeper]]. The Ball Fondlers fought off most of his men, but Erlic and one lower-ranking soldier escaped into the wood.
