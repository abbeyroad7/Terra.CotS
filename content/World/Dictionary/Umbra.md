# Introduction
Umbra, the counterbalance to [[Arcane]] magic, is a mysterious and shadowy form of destruction magic that draws its power from darkness, shadow, and the hidden aspects of reality. While [[Arcane|Arcana]] harnesses the energy of light, order, and the tangible elements of the universe, Umbra magic thrives in the realms of chaos, obscurity, and the intangible.
