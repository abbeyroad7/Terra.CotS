# Background
Garla Skullgore is a young adult half-orc born out of the Forgehealm district in [[Aurelia]] to an orc mother and a human father. Growing up, she struggled with being outcast for being of mixed-race, along with the violence and worries of poverty.

In her teenage years, her parents were killed during [[The Witchfire Crusades]], cementing her life-long hatred for the [[Gloridia|Gloridian Empire]].

By 19, she joined the ranks of the [[Arcane Liberation Front|ALF]], and has since risen to third-in-command. When available, Garla insists on leading most combat missions.
