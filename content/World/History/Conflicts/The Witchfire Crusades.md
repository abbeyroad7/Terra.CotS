# Introduction
Following [[The Divine Restoration]] in 1388 TC, [[Sorvyn, the Necromancer|Sorvyn's]] demonic armies scattered across the globe. [[Gloridia]], still wounded from the damage inflicted by the necromancer, sought to eliminate all remaining Arcane energy and led a ruthless charge to remove its scourge from the world.

Gloridian troops scoured its borders with a kill on sight order for all beings declared as devilish, both sapient and non-sapient. As the practice of Arcane fell out of favor in its lands, the Aurelian government set its foreign policy centered around extending its systemic extermination abroad.

In a world weary of war and bloodshed, Gloridia soon doubled its territorial borders into the newly-formed Gloridian Empire through conquest and intimidation of neighboring rival states.
