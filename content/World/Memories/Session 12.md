# The Lone Ranger and the Bear
After taking a short-rest, the party with [[Elara Moonshade|Elara]] abandoned their rowboat and climbed out of the cave. Outside the cavern, [[Player Characters|The Good Guys]] stood on a small eyot.

The river before them rushed past. They could see a flock of [[Cloudhopper|Cloudhoppers]] bounce overhead.

After devising a plan to cross, Goobert tied a rope to the lone oak tree near the cave's entrance and dived into the river with it in-tow.

He crossed and secured the rope with a a stake from his pack and the party managed to cross with their cargo.

On land, they discovered a set of small boot prints leading to the forest. They followed and came upon a dirt road. Continuing onward, they met a split in the path. As they arbitrated on which direction to take, Borislav took notice of the fallen statue. It was of [[Malik Windwalker]], a Gloridian folk-hero, famous for single-handedly defeating an army of orcs in [[The Arcanum Wars]]. The statue had been felled and decapitated.

The party settled on taking the path heading east based on a vision from [[Leika's Stone]].

Up the road, they encountered a snarling brown bear in the underbrush. Half the party immediately fell to the ground and played dead, but [[Borislav]] and [[Goobert]] stood their ground. [[Borislav]] was slashed and bitten before the party finally managed to defeat the beast and proceed to scavenge its pelt and meat.

As the party continued, they came upon a deserted lumber camp. The entrance was open, with a long trail of dried blood smeared across the ground. A number of [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] soldiers lay dead at the center of the campsite, with a dozen or so fallen loggers nearby.

As they investigated, a lone archer took aim at [[Freya]] and let loose a volley of arrows. The members of the party aware of the attack took cover, while [[Yeldarb]] urinated on an open gravestone. [[Elara Moonshade|Elara]] had gone to find Yeldarb, while [[Scribbles]] searched the logging cabin.

As the team roused to the ambush, they pivoted their way around the sniper, and vaulted the fence to the treeline and surrounded a man with a shirt insignia similar to that of the dead loggers. Upon learning his backstory, [[Yeldarb]] the Barbarian relented in his rage and explained to the man that they were not affiliated with the [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] army and were merely seeking to rescue [[Hilda Goldvein]].

The man calmed himself and put down his longbow. Ashamed of his grave assumption, he introduced himself as [[Dorian Blackwood]]. [[Dorian Blackwood|Dorian]] apologized to the adventurers and offered them a single health potion as reparation. He went on to explain that their campsite had been attacked 3 days prior, after [[Hilda Goldvein|Hilda]] had come there for refuge. In the onslaught, he had escorted Hilda into the woods north towards the [[Eldermyst River]].

By the time he returned, the [[Order of Celestria|Celestrians]] had gone and killed the rest of his lumbermen. Since then, he had perched himself into a tree overlooking the grounds, waiting for any [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] who dared come back.

The party gifted [[Dorian Blackwood|Dorian]] some food provisions and healing spells before they parted north. Soonafter, the party set up camp for the night along the riverfront and ate fresh bear stew.
