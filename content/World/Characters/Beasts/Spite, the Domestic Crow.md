# Background
Spite is an adult male crow who was domesticated by a cruel shopkeeper in the [[Amber Quay]] marketplace. Upon seeing his kinsmen behind a cage, [[Scribbles]] haggled with the shopkeeper for the immediate release of Spite. Ever since, the newly-freed crow has dedicated himself to professing his everlasting loyalty to the gracious Kenku wizard any way he can.
