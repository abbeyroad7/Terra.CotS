# Introduction
Aurelia serves as the Capital city of the [[Gloridia|Gloridian Empire]]. Boasting a population of 653,766 citizens, Aurelia is one of the largest and most diverse cities in the [[Terra|World]].
# Districts
## Tanner's Market
Situated outside the guard of the city's walls, the Tanner's Market was used as a low-cost market catering cheaply-made goods and trinkets to tourists traveling through. Following the [[Siege of Aurelia]], the market was razed to the ground and pilfered through by [[Order of Celestria|Celestrian]] soldiers.
## Hart's Ward
Hart's Ward is a commercial district situated to the south of Aurelia. With a higher presense of Imperial Guard, more traditional wares and artisinal goods are sold here than in the Tanner's Market.
## Feytown
Feytown serves as a largely residential district for the middle class denizens of Aurelia. Many of whom travel to neighboring districts to work. While many of the houses here are close-quartered, the people here typically fall in line as middle-class.
## Silverhorn
Silverhorn serves as the logistical support hub for addressing the basic needs for the peoples of Aurelia. Here, the city's wastewater system is controlled and monitored. In addition, the city's garbage collection, land trade, and food supply is channeled through here.
## Regal Isle
Regal Isle is a mostly-residential district exclusive to the wealthiest members of Aurelia. Its upper class origins seperates it from nearby districts, and it is even enclosed in a secondary wall inside the city's gates.
## Forgehealm
Forgehealm is a work district in Aurelia, where most of the city's raw materials are processed. Many worksmiths and depots are found here. In addition, many of the city's lower income citizens live here in dilapitaded housing. Crime is rampant in this area.
## Grove Knot
Grove Knot serves as a working district outside the city gates to the northwest of Aurelia. It primarily serves as a lumber and mining depot, where blue collar workers mine and extract raw materials for the city.
## Wolfpointe
Wolfpointe is a northern district, halfway split within and outside the city walls. It serves primarily as the barracks and outposts for the city guard.
## Rusthaven
Rusthaven is a port district, where much of the city's fishing and naval trade take place along the [[Eldermyst River]].
## Highfall District
Highfall serves as a mixed residential district to the east, where the upper middle class reside.
## Citadel District
The Citadel District is situated in the south center. This district serves the ruling class, where official government buildings and military outposts reside.
## East Aurelia
East Aurelia is situated across the [[Eldermyst River]] to the northeast of the city, and serves as a mixed residential and commercial area along the river.
