![[Elara Moonshade.webp|left|512]]
# Background
Elara Moonshade is a female adult elf. Little is known of her origin, but she was introduced to the party while they were searching for [[Matilda Goldvein]] at the Goldvein Residence.

After a tense standoff with [[Yeldarb]], she proclaimed herself to the party as a close friend of the Goldveins, and sought to reunite Matilda and her family. Reluctantly, the party allowed her to join them into the secret tunnels under the Goldvein Residence.

In the tunnels however, she proved to be susceptible to the draws of liquor, and reveled in some Dwarven ale found in a booby-trapped storeroom. This would later prove detrimental to her ability to fire a crossbow.
