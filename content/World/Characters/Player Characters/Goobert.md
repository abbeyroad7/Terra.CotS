# Introduction
Goobert is an adult Plasmoid and rogue. He specializes in thievery and uses his gel-like body to squeeze into tight spaces. His pathology revolves around helping those that help him - that is, until he is physically threatened.

# Background
Goobert grew up living in a large city and was ostracized for 'looking different'. He could never find a job and resorted to living in the sewers and using the sewer system to pull off heists. After a heist-gone-wrong, he's currently on the run after getting caught robbing the mayor.

# Evolution
After visiting the [[Aurelian National Bank]], Goobert pulled a grey heavy stone from the Knave's Vault. Unbeknownst to the Plasmoid, the stone grants the beholder visions of the past.

Intrigued by the arts of [[Arcane|Arcana]], Goobert took a special interest in becoming an Artificer.
