# Introduction
Freya is an adult Fire Genasi and druid to the Circle of the Land. She is often a loner but deep down longs for friendship. She idealizes nature and its consistence to change. She's bonded by family, despite fears that she won't see them again, and to the polar wasteland that she was banished to. At her core, she is defiant.

# Background
Freya hails from the [[Balfran 1|Principality of Balfran]], a land to the east of the [[Klaven Peninsula]]. As a Fire Genasi, she was exiled from the lands of her people for the practice of druidic magic. Heartbroken, she wandered as far north as she could possibly go, and setup shelter in the remote tundra of the Ettnian Empire. Here, she lived for years, healing from the emotional scars her people inflicted on her. Despite this, she still clings onto the love and hope that she may one day return to her homeland.
