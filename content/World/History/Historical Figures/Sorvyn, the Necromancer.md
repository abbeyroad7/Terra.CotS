# Introduction
Sorvyn, the Necromancer, born of unknown origin and age, was a formidable wielder of dark arts, who aspired to ascend mortality and claim Godhood. Through the manipulation of arcane energies and the forbidden arts of necromancy, he sought to consolidate all the [[Arcane]] of the world, believing he would be able to reshape reality and time at will.

Driven by his thirst for dominion, Sorvyn sought to usurp the Gods and rule with absolute authority, wielding the [[Power of Creation]] as his scepter. His journey was one of treachery and malice, leaving a wake of death and decay wherever he went, as he pursued the ultimate quest for apotheosis.
