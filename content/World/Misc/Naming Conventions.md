# Introduction
Many of the names I've chosen for the campaign follow Proto-Norse/Germanic/French linguistic models. Using these languages as a template for prefixes and suffixes, I've combined and altered these words to fit more smoothly into an English pronunciation.

Examples include:
- [[Aiskhel]] = Corpse hell
- [[Svalgheim]] = Swallowed world
- [[Terra Calendar (TC)|Blótmálnur]] = Blood month
