## Introduction
Reading books found across Terra will enlighten players to different topics that could prove useful in day-to-day adventuring, or could even inspire them on their most dreary of days.
### Gameplay
Books can be read during a short or long rest and are completed based on a Progression system predicated on a character's Intelligence.

**Progression: INT * 5**
Each hour a character is immersed into a book, they will roll an Intelligence check and multiply the value by 5 to calculate their progress.

Bonuses relevant to the subject material are gained when a book is read in-full and committed into the players' Memory.

#### Memory
As a counterbalance to reading bonuses, effects gained are temporary based on a Memory Slot system. Players will each have 4 slots for books that they can commit into their long-term memory.

Characters are able to expand their memory by improving their Intelligence stat. **For each +1 to their Intelligence, a character will receive an additional Memory Slot.**

**Books that have fallen out of memory will lose their related bonuses, but can be reread with Advantage when rolling the Intelligence check.**

### Reading Effects
Most books will provide Advantage Rolls when the subject matter of the book is recalled into question. In addition, nonfiction books related to Wilderness or the Arcanum Wars could potentially improve certain character skills such as Survival or History.
