Impressed by the party's conduct for survival in the Aurelian sewers, [[Fjornir Thornbrook]] formally invited them to join the [[Arcane Liberation Front]]. After some nonserious discussion, the party agreed to help the resistance faction in their quest to liberate arcana in the world of Terra.

The party chose to relinquish the Ball Fondlers moniker and reinvent themselves by choosing a new party title - the Good Guys and then, Yeldarb.

Fjornir had [[Rasha]] design forged documentation for the party members and introduced to them their Celestrian identifier sashes.

The Party went about their way out of the sewers and traveled north to the manhole exit into Feytown.

Goobert lifted the cover and escaped into the street without being seen. As a diversion, he lit an oil fire down the street so that his comrades could come street-level as well.

Once everyone had come out, they combed around Elli's manor, only to find it deserted. Inside Elli's stationary, they found some receipts directed to political figures in Aurelia, as well as a drafted personal letter addressed to someone named Puck, inviting them to meet at 1PM at the Black Market.

The party asked the nearby barkeep if he knew of its whereabouts and after receiving the information, they made a dash to the market to find Puck and Elli whispering amongst themselves in a room off to the side of the market.

A battle ensued, and the party managed to capture both fairies, bringing them back to ALF-HQ for interrogation.
