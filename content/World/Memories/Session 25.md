# The Forest of Petrified Trees
As you look upon the decrepit hut before you, you notice the material structure seems impossibly old, its thin walls made of twisted wood that creaks and groans.

Inside, you find Yeldarb seated at a rickety table, his face illuminated by a faint, swirling glow coming from an ancient map sprawled before him. The map seems alive, its ink shifting and twisting as if charting routes to unseen places.

Yeldarb is entranced, his eyes glazed over. The map's light flickers and pulses, breaking its hold on Yeldarb.

You notice Freya's pack begins to glow. The same familiar voice that had warned you in the Citadel's dungeons comes through the Stone, clearer than before.

“You must hurry,” she urges. “The Forest of Petrified Trees is not far from here, but the plane’s grip on you grows stronger still. I've left this map for you as a guide. Find me in a marked grove just beyond the red thicket.”

### The Forest of Petrified Trees
The party enters the forest, where jagged, fossilized trees fìll your vision.

On closer inspection, the twisted bark seems to form the anguished visages of forgotten Elves, their mouths frozen in silent screams and eyes hollowed by time. The faces shift subtly in your periphery, their anguished visages growing more pronounced. You feel as though they are watching you.

A battle ensues with the Undead Trees.

After the battle, you notice a deep-red color, just beyond the corpse of one of the fallen trees. It stands out to you, as the only saturation in this place seems to be closer to greyscale.

You climb the hill to investigate the source of the out-of-place color and recognize the face you had last seen slain back at the Church in Rusthaven. Hilda Goldvein is sitting at the base of yet another oak tree. She smiles up at you as you approach.

"It's good to see you're all still alive," she says. "We've little time. I've brought you here to harvest the Seeds of Eidolon, so you can leave this place and fulfill the prophecy of Old."

She rummages through the withered vegetation and plucks a strange fruit from its stem.

"Take these with you," she gestures. "When the fruit is eaten, it will grant you the strength to resist the pulls of Aiskhel and later, Svalgheim," her voice trails.

You harvest seven Seeds of Eidolon.

"You see, the only recourse for a Live Soul to leave the Tangent Realms is to climb through the Pits of the Nine Hells. Only then, will you find the Ethereal Gateway to the Mortal Coil."

"I must again, warn you. The journey through Svalgheim will be of great peril. It is prophecized that only the Goodness of Men can stop the Shadowwalker and I fear it is your lot who has been tasked by the Gods to do so.

You continue onward with Hilda through the grove, and come out into a clearing at the base of a range of mountains. Per Hilda's map, your party has arrived to the base of the Aroanian Mountains.
